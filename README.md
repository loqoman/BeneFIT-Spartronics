Poggers, Christmas is here!
I am here to spread the Christmas cheer!
Don’t be naughty! Be nice!
Or else, you’ll pay the price!

Hey everybody, I’m the Christmas MC,
Here to give you people some holiday glee!
I came in from the northern pole,
To tell you kids how to not get coal!

Step one: you gotta be nice,
Avoid any sins or vice!
If someone offers you weed, tell them no,
Or else, santa will know!

Take it from me, a guy who’s been imprisoned,
The devils’ game is not the right decision.
Lucky for me, everything’s under control,
I just completed my very long parole!
